Dear Sir,

I hope this message finds you well. As a student facing financial constraints, I am earnestly seeking the opportunity to publish my article. I kindly request your consideration for free publication, as this opportunity would significantly assist me in sharing my work and contributing to the literary community. I want to assure you of the quality of my work and its strict adherence to professional standards.

I have previously reached out to my college for support regarding this article, but unfortunately, I have not received any responses from them. Therefore, I am turning to your esteemed publication with the hope of receiving a positive response and the chance to share my work with a broader audience.

I have attached my portfolio for your reference, which can be accessed at the following link: Portfolio Link here

Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my request and for your support.

Best regards,
G. Gopi Krishna,
Final year Btech CSE, Lovely Professional University(2024).
