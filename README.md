# How to publish the term/research paper for free in reputated journals

1. **First write a term paper.** This includes:
    * Title
    * Research
    * Reading books to understand the topic
    * Writing the content
2. **Select any journal and submit your paper.**
3. **After 2-3 days, you will receive the results of your paper submission.** The paper must have an originality of at least 85% and a review score of at least 3/5 to be accepted.
4. **If your paper is accepted, you will receive an email with the next steps to pay the Article Processing Charges (APC) for the article.**
5. **Request the journal head to publish your article for free.** Write a professional email (attaching a sample request info) and attach your portfolio and resume.
6. **After 2-5 days, you will receive an email from the journal head regarding free publication without APC charges.** This email will contain a link.
7. **Click on the link and fill in your information.** Submit the required documents:
    * College ID card
    * Word file and PDF file of article
    * APC screenshot
    * DOI link

**Note:** I have published papers in IJAENT and IJSCE using this method.

* Advantages
* Applications
* Setbacks
